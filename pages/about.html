    <h3>Welcome to my Website</h3>
    <p>I am a web developer in training. My ultimate goal is to create web services that help organizations operate more
        safetly.</p>
    <p>I currently work for an insurance underwriting company, where I underwrite an Active Assailant insurnace program,
        which helps organizations prevent and respond to deadly weapon events.</p>
    <p>Using my background, I hope to create apps that will help schools and hospitals prevent workplace violence.</p>
